# A Brief Guide to Controlling the World 

In my quest for world domination, I have learned to things.

- You can't control everything. Oh well, we take what we can get.

- You can control a lot. Which is so surprising that it really needs explaining.

## What do you see?

When you look at a table of data, what do you see?
I see:

+ A table of examples of some function that can predict for `y` given `x`;
+ And those examples are expressed in ranges (sets of similar values)

When you look at data this way, often a surprisingly small number of ranges
matter (and the rest can be ignored). And that's why creatures as dumb as us
aps can (sometimes) be surprisingly effective.

## What uses what

Are you 
interested in how data miners can spark discussions
that lead to better insights that lead to better
conclusions? Then read this book to learn how to mine insights from data.

Do not read this book if:

- You are still confused about how data miners work;
- Your users argue back when those data miners make a conclusion;
- No one asks you to succincntly share what you've learned from your data;


If those two things are true
then you do not need this code.

But if you are still reading, then


Locate the shapes in the mist. Cut the dull ones.

Test these in the following order:

+ lua libok.lua
+ lua randok.lua
+ lua colsok.lua
+ lua nsvok.lua
